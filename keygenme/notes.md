## Keygenme-py

##### [writeup](https://github.com/ZeroDayTea/PicoCTF-2021-Killer-Queen-Writeups/blob/main/ReverseEngineering/keygenmepy.md)

- Analyze keygenme-trial.py
- Static part is given already (Half flag).
- Look for a way to decode dynamic part.
- run soln.py then when the program starts exit id by option "d" you will notice flag at last.
- soln2.py is more simple.
